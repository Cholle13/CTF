#Rest in Pepperoni-Pizzas(100)  
##Problem  
I gave my little sister a flag, but she cut it up and hid the pieces! Retrieve it here:https://github.com/jdeans289/easyctf-2015-writeups/blob/master/files/ripinpizzas.pdf  
##Hint  
Have fun! If you do it by the paper-and-scissors method, share it to @easyctf !  
##Write-Up
When I first opened the pdf there was nothing to be found. So I decided to open up the pdf in Adobe Illustrator where I was able to remove two layers to reveal a third layer filled with jigsaw pieces. When I saw the pieces I enlarged the picture of jigsaw pieces and printed them out. I then took a pair of scissors cutting each piece out and connecting them together to where I could read the flag.
